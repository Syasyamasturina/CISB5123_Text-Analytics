Alexandre S.,11/26/2020 7:02:08 PM,"Pros: -IPS panel
-Color accurate
-Really good price
-G-Sync compatible
-HDR is ok, it works fine in games but doesn't work as good in Netflix. Great on Youtube.
Cons: -The stand don't rotate but I personally use an arm.
-The biggest con is the ghosting, I'm coming from an Asus VG248QE 1080p 144Hz TN panel. The color on my old panel are washed out but there's no ghosting or trail. With the new one it's a little bit bad. If you play CSGO, R6 or other competitive games, it's not the best. I have use this monitor for 2 weeks now and it's a little bit better when you're adapt to it but it's not the greatest. The best settings i've found is Overdrive at SPEED and FreeSync Premium On so you can activate G-Sync in the Nvidia control panel. I also turned on Low latency in Nvidia control panel. You can try Super Resolution, in some games it can help to see better with high FPS but it's weird in some vegetation like trees.
Overall Review: I'm still keeping it because I don't think it's the worst you can have.
It's at a good price, I see better in 1440p and if I really need the fast pixels response time, I'll use my Asus. The colors are really great for movies and games and I love HDR. 

In the video, the first monitor is the Gigabyte and the second one is The Asus VG248QE."
Precise,10/25/2020 8:24:49 AM,"Pros: Hi, I've been using this monitor for several days.

I can say that it is easy on the eyes, the matte finish really prevents any type of screen glare from any light. I haven't noticed any dead pixels or black light bleed.

Windows reports it as 8-bit + Dithering, HW info reports it as 10 bit.

Out of the box, with digital vibrance turned up the monitor has some really nice and rich colours. HDR mode works, although you can achieve similar colors without HDR and just tuning the settings. The Freesync is working as intended I think, it is matching my refresh rate to my frames in game. Im using a GTX 1080 so It's probably the middle point for this type of monitor. Some games look really awesome, WoW looks great, Apex looks great, Destiny 2 in HDR looks great.

There can be a small issue though, where the monitor won't go into standby mode but it seems to be resolved by switching the ""Auto Input selection"" to ""OFF"" in the monitors settings it has fixed the issue for myself and several other users (credit to zeich)**

Gsync works pretty well, if your able to achieve over 70 fps you wont even notice when the difference moving between 70 hz to 144 hz when in Gsync mode, it's really that smoooth. Gsync seems to work well untill you get to the 40-60 fps range where you might experience some light stuttering in some games like WoW.

I haven't done any color calibration, im using the colours out of the box with my digital vibrance in NVCP to 90% and Windows HDR on full at all time, honestly it looks pretty amazing. White actually looks white. Black looks black for the most part

Also I do not notice any ghosting in-game with the Speed overdrive mode.

The software to control the settings is pretty easy to use, and works well. The live update and firmware update worked with no errors.

Some people complain about the button on the back of the monitor but in my feeling of it the button is actually simple and easy to use.

My overall conclusion, for the price point I think it's a steal, although I am not a pro with monitors but I did spend 3 weeks watching and comparing different reviews before I decided to buy this one.

Overall I am happy with my purchase, colors look great and no noticeable ghosting in game.

Hopefully some people found this review to be useful, and Please share your experiences with this monitor.
Cons: Some people have an issue where the monitor wont enter standby mode, this CAN BE RESOLVED by switching the Auto Input Selector to OFF in the monitors settings (navigate with the button not the software for this)
Overall Review: Yes, recommended."
KASON L.,5/21/2021 4:31:55 AM,"Pros: 1440p IPS HDR 144HZ
Cons: None At the time
Overall Review: Its kind of a lengthly review but there are questions people have and i have answers!
This monitor after having it for only a couple days is awesome. I will keep this review updated but as of now this thing is incredible. Lets start off with the big question. 

PS5 compatible? Answer is YES! This monitor has a feature that is a built in Downscaler. Which means it will trick the ps5 into thinking its a 4k display then will downscale it to 1440p. I tested out Ratchet & Clank 2016 on the ps5 and it does indeed have the fidelity of 4k and runs at 60fps. Now its says 2160p @ 60Hz which is true because most native 4k games wont run higher than 60fps. So if you are looking for a monitor for the PS5 (which currently at this time Doesnt have 1440p support) this is perfect rather than dropping $350+ on a decent 4k monitor. Now in time if the demand is high enough sony did say that they could add support for 1440p and that it wasnt a hardware problem more as its geared more towards 1080p and 4k tvs

Pc gaming! The jump from 1080p to 1440p is a big one. Coming from a 24 1080p ips panel this is a big change in pixel density and you can see it big time. I have a ryzen 7 3700x and rtx 2070 (non super). Most the game i play are competitive games like warzone, apex, csgo, valorant. (Then other AAA Titles for singleplayer like cyberpunk, upcoming the day before, mass effect legendary edition, halo infinite ect) its is amazing. Now there is a noticable fps difference between 1080p and 1440p if you have settings cranked up. As for me i play mostly low setting with native resolution and i get 140+ in apex, 300+ in valorant and csgo. Now warzone is a different beast. With the DlSS added for higher resolution gamers its wonderful. At 1440p med/low settings with dlss set to quality you get 125-135 fps. (Which is 1080p performance more or less)
Older games such has Halo Master Chief collection run flawless with everything cranked up. 

Needless to say that this monitor is the best I have owned. (I have owned multiple 1080p and 2 1440p monitors and this one takes the cake by far)
The adjustable stand is an amazing. One if the best things you could need. No need for a monitor arm if you have the desk room for it. That stand itself is sturdy and doesnt wobble at all. It has a tilt feature aswell i have mine tilted up more and maxed out on the height setting because im tall and it hurts my next to look down. (Im 62 and it sits on a ikea linnmon desk for reference). 

Lets talk what comes in the box aswell!
The monitor and base (obviously)
Display port cable
Hdmi cable
Ac power brick and wall plug (comes with US,EU, and Australia wall plug i believe.)

I was very happy they included 3 different wall plugs so if you are looking for a monitor that has them this is the one.

UI for the monitor is great. The button on the back is just one so its confusing at first to know which direction does what but its very user friendly and easy to navigate.

Lets talk panel quality. Its very glare prone because of how the ips panel is. Its almost looks like obsidian (real life obsidian. An extremely dark black gloss) so glare is a big one. That is really the only downside but not really. 

If there is ANYTHING else i missed feel free to ask. As i will keep this updated periodically if anything happens by itself ( not if i break it by accident)"
Anonymous,6/9/2021 1:01:18 AM,"Pros: -144hz
-2560x1440
-thin side and top bezels
-sturdy stands
-usb 3.0 2 port hub
-low IPS glow
Cons: - strong back light bleed
-optional OSD sidekick software
-IPS glow
Overall Review: This monitor is marketed as a ""gaming monitor"" and rightfully so. fast response times, good darks and lights, high resolution. in a gaming environment this monitor is flawless 10/10 recommend any day. 
 the problem comes when stepping into a productivity environment. high standards such as its claimed 92% DCI-P3 and HDR400 fall flat when the atrocious backlight bleed from the top of the monitors causes visible color distortions across 50-60% of the top edge of the screen. I purchased 2 of these at the same time and both came with very similar backlight bleed. cant claim to know they all do but my sample size is 2. Noticeable IPS glow when looking for it but not really a problem except in low brightness or color critical applications.
 OSD software is more of a gimmick than something of value. the latest version is not compatible with running 2 monitors at the same time while an older version is. the software allows you to change your monitors settings though software and avoid using the hardware joystick on the back of the monitor.
 Overall great gaming ONLY monitor. if you plan on only gaming this monitor knocks it out of the park. if you plan on doing light photo editing/color critical work this monitor is probably not for you."
Anonymous,7/21/2022 5:47:52 PM,"Pros: If your lucky enough to get one that's working it's an ok monitor for the price
Cons: Even though Gigabyte says that their products have warranties good luck actually getting them to honor it.
Overall Review: Within a month and a half of having my monitor it had multiple stuck and dead pixels across the screen. I went and requested an RMA through the Gigabyte website and was approved. They made me pay for my own shipping to the RMA facility and I received no updates for over a week after it got there. When I finally heard something back they were telling me that they were sending back the monitor without repairing it. Once I got it back I checked the monitor and it was not fixed and now had fingerprints and dirt all over it. I reached out to their coustomer service through email and after initially hearing back from someone they would repeatedly leave me with no reply for weeks at a time. I got fed up with the lack of responses and finally called their phone number and got put on hold for an hour and a half. After someone finally picked up and i explained my situation to them, they told me that it was human error that they didn't fix my monitor and offered no more help or any sort of compensation for my shipping cost. Looking at other people's experiences with their RMA process many of them are having similar experiences to me where they get their product back in worse shape than they sent it out in and without repair."
Anonymous,9/3/2020 6:26:01 AM,"Pros: - Stand is as sturdy as those made by Dell.
- 144Hz G-Sync works as advertised.
- HDR works as advertised.
- Excellent colors and brightness.
Cons: - Wished bezels were a bit thinner.
- Colors need to be calibrated out of the box.
Overall Review: Buy this if you want an excellent quality 1440p high refresh monitor. Great for content consumption, content creation, and gaming. Great all around"
Joshua C.,1/22/2021 6:39:48 PM,"Pros: -Bright
-Good colors
-smooth
Cons: - only gripe is why I knocked it an egg is that whenever my computer turns off display from being idle, the monitor does this thing where it dims everything and only way to fix it is turning the monitor on and off. Tried researching this if maybe it's a monitor issue or a windows feature or something. But I have a second monitor that is a different brand and it doesn't do this.
Overall Review: Any advice on how to change this setting would be helpful!"
Anonymous,9/1/2020 8:53:05 PM,"Pros: - Great viewing angles
- 144 Hz
- Good colors
Cons: - None at the moment.
Overall Review: This monitor is pretty great overall. I've had it for a few hours and the 1440p experience is fantastic. 144 Hz is good for any sort of competitive gaming. I haven't had any dead pixels or any sort of problem with the panel. Would definitely recommend this monitor to anybody wanting to upgrade from 1080p since the difference is certainly there."
Kevin L.,11/2/2020 9:58:42 AM,"Pros: - 144 fps
- Very good colorful display (IPS)
- Very low glow on my monitor (maybe im lucky) 
- No flickering
- Monitor can be modified directly in windows with OSD sidekick app (with keyboard shortcut to change profile, i found it very useful to change between reader(work)/gaming/movie profile.
Cons: - When connected with display port, the monitor wont go into 'sleep' by turning off the screen. It will show a black screen saver but the monitor is till on. It makes me wanna close it more often because of that (to protect it i guess ?). Other owners have the same problem so its probably a firmware issue that will be updated in the future.
Overall Review: Here in Canada you cant have a better bang for your buck with this display for and 1440p 144hz IPS monitor. Going from TN 60 fps to this monitor is a HUGE upgrade."
Anas,8/8/2022 4:32:15 PM,"Pros: -It was a good monitor i would've recommended to everyone
Cons: -Video does not show at all after 2 month of normal usage
-The ""global"" warranty gigabyte offers does not apply to this so chances are you might get a faulty monitor and not get a refund or replacement
-Trying to talk to gigabyte wont help at all if you dont have any gigabyte maintenance place near you.
Overall Review: basically i ordered this monitor, life was good it was so amazing. Two months in the monitor started taking around 5 minutes after turning on to display anything (controls still work and the backlight still turns on), a few days later it starts to take longer to display anything and i started to contact gigabyte by then but the response that i got was they did not cover the global warranty (which is supposed to be a year from gigabyte's website). I tried contacting newegg but was told i couldn't refund because i was two months in at the time. i contacted gigabyte many times (they take like a week to reply back disappointment). After many tries best thing i got from gigabyte was to send the monitor to the nearest maintenance place (which was like india or something i live in Saudi Arabia, so i'll be paying a LOT to get it there AND back AND pay the maintenance price) AND if they find any problems with it they will fix it FROM MY MONEY, I'll just be paying more than what I've paid for getting the monitor in the first place! Utterly disappointing from gigabyte as the ""global warranty"" somehow did not include someone who's supposed to be under the ""global warranty""."
Colton K.,10/31/2022 3:27:52 PM,"Pros: Monitor worked ok for 2 months but now it won't power on. I've confirmed that the power adapter is supplying proper power/voltage, but the power indicator and panel are entirely non-responsive. Getting help from Gigabyte for a warranty claim has been awful.

Anonymous,4/8/2021 2:08:31 PM,"Pros: - Great color and crisp picture- Works well as a work or gaming display- USB pass throughs are a nice touch- The fact that the speakers (although weak) arent terrible is a pro in itself
Cons: - Unfortunately, my display has one dead pixel. I do not notice it while working in spreadsheets, surfing the web, or most action-oriented gaming (first person shooters), but when in a dark cutscene or watching a movie where the camera is fixed for a period of time it is noticeable.
Overall Review: My overall experience with this monitor has been wonderful, with the exception of that dead pixel. I use it for work (spreadsheets, word processing, various applications) and gaming.The 1440p resolution provides a lot of screen space to work in while producing sharp graphics in games. The 144hz refresh rate is nice too, as Im able to enjoy 120-144 frames per second in nearly every game I play. This review would have been 5 eggs, but... dead pixel."
Anonymous,11/27/2020 10:33:04 PM,"Pros: -Solid stands
-Good construction
-Beautiful colors and smooth picture
Cons: -Only a joystick for the menu, but I don't mind
-Windows likes to do the USB disconnect every time they go to sleep, and somehow gets stuck in a loop, but it may be my mouse waking it up.(Using DisplayPort)
Overall Review: I bought 2 of these to replace my older 24"" 1080p IPS Acer, and 27"" 1440p IPS acer, both 60hz monitors.

I was about to have to work from home, so I figured with needing a lot of different windows open, I'd go ahead and have two of the exact same monitors for the first time, and wanted 144hz as I plan to upgrade my CPU and GTX 1070 later to better utilize the 144hz, so far even just running 70-90fps in games, it still feels smoother, and I swear the colors are cleaner and vibrant vs my old acers, which may have just been age.

Regardless I am incredibly happy with both of these, I recommend a Viso dual monitor arm stand if your desk isn't very large, it greatly helped with my desk space running out."
Anonymous,1/6/2022 11:37:37 AM,"Pros: It was a great monitor for the price. Worked amazingly.
Cons: After a couple months of use, all of a sudden the screen goes black and has never showed anything else.
Overall Review: Just one day when I was using it, the screen just goes all black but you can see that the monitor is still on through the light and is getting recognized by the computer. I have tried a lot of different troubleshooting options such as changing power cables for the monitor, changing the input cable used, switching graphics cards, using different inputs (hdmi and display port), but none of them have worked. I have contacted support but they have yet to respond.

All in all, the monitor just stopped working after a couple of months."
Disappointed,9/24/2021 11:26:27 PM,"Pros: Some of the screen looks good
Cons: The other parts of the screen are terrible. Black screen shows all the lighting issues
Overall Review: No, spend a lil more and get better"
Anonymous,1/4/2021 12:05:45 PM,"Overall Review: I was a bit skeptical on purchasing this monitor at first due to its price point but wow am i impressed. I did a lot of panel type research and decided that the IPS panel was the panel i would enjoy the most because of its wide range of vivid colors. Out of the box, the settings were great but once you tune it to your liking (especially for gaming, including setting up free-sync and the 144hz along with it's amazing 1ms response time) the monitor is a beast. The response time is factory set so no need to worry about that but for v-sync/ free sync, you have an option to disable and enable it in the monitor settings. The 144hz has to be set up in Windows display settings. Once on, the screen is as fluid as water when playing games and even just moving the mouse cursor. I downgraded from a 4k tv to a 2k monitor and the transition was as seamless as it could be. Definitely recommend this monitor for gaming and overall usage. You will not be disappointed."
Anonymous,8/22/2023 10:37:59 PM,"Cons: Dead pixels are starting to form in under 2 months of owning it.
Overall Review: Hope mine is an outlier, but I've had this screen for less than 2 months and there's some dead pixels forming in the upper right portion of the screen. Hope it doesn't get worse, it was a good monitor before this, but can't really recommend something that starts to break so early on."
Anonymous,3/31/2022 12:31:16 PM,Overall Review: 🔥🔥
Jeff C.,4/20/2021 6:31:06 PM,"Pros: -The resolution 2560 x 1440 is vastly superior to the standard 1080x 1980
-Height adjustable (THIS IS A MUST)
-Built in speakers (THIS IS A MUST)
- Several input options
-Accurate colors
-Dashboard which displays system info at a glance
Cons: There is a single button to control settings. It is a toggle switch/button that can either be pressed or toggled up/down/left/right. It is very awkward to use and a real hassle. While it's not a deal breaker it annoys the spit out of me. If you are somebody who frequently needs to go through the settings and adjust things you should consider this. It may not bother other people, but I can't stand it.
Overall Review: I would definitely purchase this again. It had all the features I wanted at the price point I wanted. It may be the only one I found that met all my requirements. I very infrequently game, but gaming monitors typically have very high quality displays. 

I will reiterate this again- I hate the toggle switch! I would much prefer discrete buttons on the front of the monitor/bezel."
Anonymous,11/18/2023 11:30:49 AM,Overall Review: Ive had this monitor for under 90 days and its been working great but all of a sudden wont turn on. Monitor hasnt moved from its place and power from outlet is working fine but monitor wont turn on. Past return period and now Im stuck with a broken monitor.
Jonathan J.,8/11/2023 7:53:06 PM,"Pros: Looks like a nice monitor 144mhz IPS
Cons: in windows on the desktop if i mouseover anything that changes color i notice a change in brightness overall like running mouse down the start menu will make the monitor flicker different brightness HDR bring turned on makes it even worse....
Overall Review: I don't know if al the monitors do this or if mine is just defective i know i had a 13 year old ips monitor that worked better than this"
James S.,11/17/2022 7:41:22 AM,"Pros: Refresh rate sure is nice, and the picture looks pretty close to the other ASUS monitor i have.
I dont have a ton of experience with gaming monitors so not a great frame of reference
Cons: The VESA mount point, inexusable in my opinion.
Weird asymmetric border around active screen
Overall Review: The VESA mount point is recessed into the back of the monitor. It seems like some people have had no issue with this, but my VESA arm (who's listing has been deleted so i cant even link it) doesn't fit. See below for instructions for anyone who buys this and runs into the same issue.

This gets three stars because i was able to fix this issue and the monitor besides this works fine.

For anyone encountering the same issue, i was able to jerry-rig a solution for this. You'll need:

 four M4 screws (same diameter and thread spacing as the black screws attaching the included stand to the monitor) that are longer than the usual ones

 a box cutter or exacto knife

 pliers

 screwdriver

First, remove the included stand from the monitor so you can access the steel screws on the face of the stand mount point

Unscrew the middle 4 screws and remove the mounting plate from the stand. You don't need to mess with any of the smaller screws near the edges

With the box cutter, cut as much as you can into the base of the plastic shroud that normally surrounds the hinge that you just removed this plate from. Cut from the outside in, as parallel to the mounting plate as you can. You don't need to cut all the way through.

With the pliers, bend and break (along your cuts) the shroud off. You can use the box cutter and pliers to remove as much excess plastic as possible from the back of the plate. The goal is to allow your VESA mount to sit flush with this surface on the mounting plate.

Pop the mounting plate onto where it normally couples with the monitor and use your longer M4 screws to just mount the monitor like normal, but now the monitor effectively has a flat back to mount to.


If you don't have the screws for this (i ended up cannibalizing some from the cable tunnel on the bottom of my VESA arm), look for any VESA mount spacer set that has spacers to the tune of 8mm (doesn't need to be exact but it does need to be at least 8mm), and offers at least four M4 screws that are at least 15mm long (measuring just the thread part of the screw). Most sets will offer a few thickness options for standoffs and several types of VESA-compatible screws, and i haven't yet seen one that doesn't offer M4 screws, so you would be fine.


And also, Gigabyte, come on. This design choice is needlessly cruel to VESA arm users and nowhere in the specification i can find does it mention this recessed mount point, let alone the internal dimensions of it."
Donn G.,1/22/2022 4:47:24 AM,"Pros: None
Cons: The screen has very noticeable fading at the edges and in all four corners. Is very noticeable in games where it would be night time, black load screens, and any other areas where its supposed to be dark
Overall Review: Not sure I would recommend this but maybe I just got a a bad one but will not buy anything again from this manufacturer"
Anonymous,12/12/2021 8:10:53 PM,"Pros: -Great 4K quality
-smooth 144hz refresh rate
-built in software and decent speakers
Cons: Can take a while to set up, experienced vertical lines when I first used it. Might have to mess around wit the software for a while.
Overall Review: (The photo was taken from my phone, it is not a screenshot)

I've owned this monitor for about a month and so far I have no complaints. Was worried because of people saying they received dead pixels or monitors that were DOA. It may take a while to setup, I recommend playing with your display settings for a while. I've run heavy games like GTA V and RDR2 at ultra graphics and it seems to keep up with the refresh rate. Also, I don't recommend using HDR on monitors like these because they see to get a bit blurry. My last monitor was a MSI 32 inch curved 4K HDR monitor, and this one is almost as good for a fraction of the price. Highly recommended for casual gaming. Built in speakers are also a plus."
Joram P.,11/19/2021 10:42:55 AM,"Pros: The refresh rage is really good and picture quality is great aswell

Overall Review: Great monitor but they really need to make sure they arent broken I would get a replacement but I need a monitor so I just have to live with it which is going to suck."
Henry D,9/6/2021 1:15:07 PM,"Pros: - Good looking screen
-OSD menu to change settings instead of digging through the monitor settings
-Decent price

- Menu Joystick broke and now unable to turn on the monitor
Overall Review: -It's taking forever to get support from Gigabyte to RMA it to get it fixed. 
-So long that it's almost broken more longer than I've owned the monitor
-Would recommend to look at a different brand because of the support issues alone."

Anonymous,8/19/2024 7:09:56 PM,"Pros: Cheap
Cons: Display is dull
Overall Review: I had a G27QC for about two years. A controller might have found the screen and needed a new monitor. So I thought I was getting the same one. (Didn't realize the sneaky ""S"") They released a 2nd edition or newer replacement. Cool whatever. But they got rid of all the good things the previous monitor had. Great color it was bright and why did they decide to get rid of the speakers and talk about cutting corners this new monitor weighs like 6 pounds and the monitor stand is probably the cheapest thing they could have gone to. Very disappointed in Gigabyte I figured it would be as good or better being the newer version but I was wrong..."
Anonymous,7/24/2024 12:09:55 PM,"Overall Review: Save your money, this monitor breaks on its own, warrenty or not, they will make you pay for the return label(unless it breaks a second time???) which for me costed $140 usd, ggs could've just bought a better and brand new monitor."
Derek M.,3/31/2024 3:09:10 PM,"Pros: - Good picture quality
- IPS
- 144Hz
- 1440p (2K)
- HDR400
- Several input options
- Vesa Mount compatible
- Nice base if you're not using a VESA mount
Cons: - Annoying bright white blinking standby light. They need to use an amber solid standby light like everyone else. I took a star off for this.
- NO DDC/CI support on this monitor! I like to use ScreenBright to adjust my monitor brightness with shortcuts and this monitor almost never works. My Acer monitor never has issues with it. Sometimes restarting Windows gets it to work with the Gigabyte monitor, but most of the time the monitor does not work with DDC/CI. So if you want to control your monitor with software through DDC/CI, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MONITOR! I verified with Gigabyte support that their monitors don't have DDC/CI support and that you have to use their own software which uses their own proprietary protocols and not the standard protocol.
- Monitor brightness flickers when AMD Freesync is turned on, I've never had issues with my prior Asus monitor doing that with Freesync.
- Another issue is the USB hub in the monitor kept waking my computer up, I couldn't figure out what was causing this until I finally got rid of this monitor and the issue magically stopped.
Overall Review: I can't recommend this monitor due to all the negatives. Difference from going from 1080p to 1440p in clarity (especially text) is good. My issues like I said is with the super bright blinking standby light that I wish would be solid amber when the monitor is in standby. The other issue being no DDC/CI support. The 3rd negative being AMD Freesync doesn't seem to work right with the monitor either, causing screen brightness flickering. 4th negative with this monitor is the USB hub in the monitor kept waking my computer up, I couldn't figure out what was causing this until I finally got rid of this monitor and the issue magically stopped."

Cons: -What keeps it from 10/10 is there's a sRGB mode that has perfect colors but you can't adjust the sharpness. When I try to get the same colors on the custom mode, I can never get the same result as sRGB. Woulda been nice to be able to simply adjust the sharpness on that mode
Overall Review: Overall I would recommend this monitor, really good price considering what you get but the colors take some adjustment. What worked for me was:
Black equalizer: 11
Super resolution: 3
Brightness: 100
Contrast: 50
Color Vibrance: 10
Sharpness: 5
Gamma: 1
Cusom Color Temp 
Red: 49
Green 48
Blue 52"
Brett T.,1/23/2024 10:19:47 AM,"Pros: It was a great monitor while it worked.
Cons: Ac adapter popped and broke my monitor.
Overall Review: Ive had this monitor for around 2.5 years. It was very solid monitor for the price range and did everything I needed. The other day I was just watching videos and I heard an audible pop. The monitor went black. I could still hear the video I was watching. So, I knew it wasnt the PC power supply. Then I noticed I couldnt turn my monitor back on. No matter what I did. I bought a replacement adapter. Tried to use it. Still wont turn on. All in all Ive been seeing a lot of other people having the problem with the adapter. But not many had it blow on them I guess. Like I did. Long story short. If you get this monitor use a different adapter so you dont run into this problem."
SilentWarrior116,1/5/2024 9:28:47 PM,"Pros: Amazing color, awesome brightness.
Cons: Lack of walk-through support, in monitor menu options lack ease of use.
Overall Review: PS5 Gigabyte G27Q 120hz Solution
If you're running into issues on the PS5 only being able to run 60hz on the Gigabyte G27Q Monitor. Enable 1440p in the Ps5 Settings, then TURN HDR OFF. After this you must change settings in game to run the 120hz refresh rate, like fortnite etc. 

Don't forget, lots of in game menus run 60hz so start the game and check the monitor settings and you'll see that beautiful 120hz. Hope this helps a lot of frustrated PS5 G27Q owners! FYI you don't need an HDMI 2.1 monitor to run 120hz, the HDMI cable that came with the G27Q works just fine. Overall impressed with this great deal."
Matt,6/2/2023 5:42:57 PM,"Pros: Very clean and clear picture. Great size for a desktop gamer. You have to put your nose almost up to the monitor to even begin to see the pixels.
Cons: It swivels up/down (+), but it doesn't swivel left and right. It slides up and down vertically. I mean, that's MY only con.
Overall Review: My last monitor was a 24"" 1920x1080 144hz monitor. By another name brand as us.. I mean, as this one. To be fair, it was the ""other"" kind of monitor. It was bright in a weird way. The FreeSync was weird.. I could see horizontal lines flickering very fast downwards with FreeSync on. And 24"" is too big for a 1920x01080 monitor. I could always see all the pixels, no matter what.

But this isn't about that.. this is about how this monitor is none of those things. Premium FreeSync, 27"" 2560x1440 144hz ""HDR 400"". I first got this monitor for my nephew's Birthday Build nearly 1.5 years ago. It's IPS. My other one I had was a TN panel.

World.. of... difference. His desktop looked so much better, games LOOKED soooo much better. So, I ended up getting the same one around a year later. Didn't care what else was out. I ""SAW"" this one with my own eyes. It's excellent.

So, to get 2560x1440 with HDR, it's gonna say on your Display options that it's 8-bit. That's all this monitor can do at 144hz because of the DisplayPort 1.2+. So, it does ""8 bit-with Dithering"" which some people swear looks the same as HDR @ 10-bits. To get HD 10-bits, you need to lower the frequency to 120hz. Not a problem, just your preference. 

I personally run 8-bit with dithering at 144hz. Not that I can see a real difference anyways. Maybe once or twice, 10-bit did look better. I'm talking about color depth, not any other option.

It's a bright monitor to just be ""HD400"". Get the Calibration Tool on the MS store and calibrate your monitor so that your desktop doesn't look bad. Mine was yellowish until I calibrated it. Then that helped everything. Now I leave HDR on all the time, because it looks quite normal on the monitor all the time.

Lastly, some games look better or the same in ""RGB 4:4:4"" Pixel Format. That's what most PC monitors tend use. TV's use the other.

However, you'll just have to experiment.. I've seen YCbCr 4:4:4 and 4:4:2 look WAY better lol. 

Besides all that, once you get used to the new HDR experience and get it tuned in.. It looks great. The colors are bright, the HDR brights can be amazing and game changing.

Lastly, the ""Premium"" Adaptive Freesync (Premium for this resolution and abilities, settings, but that's the official term) is flawless. ZERO flickering. Just SMOOTH all the time. Even wtih it off, the thing is SMOOTH. I have been using it for months with it on, but I also remember liking it off. But some games NEEDED it with that rig (3600/RX480 8GB). I've left it on with the 6700XT 12GB + 5900x. Seems perfectly suited for that 80-120+ fps range I'm getting. But even 40 feels good. 70+ always feels great. It feels great everywhere. 

Great monitor."
Dirrin,4/22/2023 4:50:20 PM,"Pros: black equalizer is nice. comes with all cables but a little short 3"". but at least comes with options. find settings that fit you. height and tilt is great.
Overall Review: Great product. ty. I play Hunt showdown and this has been night and day difference from 1080p"
Calvin H.,4/3/2023 7:18:45 AM,"Pros: 27"", 2k
Cons: AMD Freesync
Overall Review: So far I've had this monitor about two years now and while it's a decent monitor it's really fxcking annoying at least 3-4 times a week the screen will randomly blackout causing me to turn it on/off. I've disabled Freesync and it still fxcking does it."
Anonymous,11/29/2022 11:37:53 AM,"Pros: Easily gets 144 fps paired with 6800xt
Decent picture quality at 1440p
Cons: Monitor has weird lighting effect in dark scenes around edges of monitor that looks like it has pressure damage and the effect keeps getting worse after a few months of use. Black colours are very poor quality. They are almost a grey, if you try to calibrate the monitor using its built in settings to correct black colours it makes any game you play that has night scenes almost unplayable.
Overall Review: Do not recommend this monitor at all, especially for the price. Already replacing it after less then a year of use."
Anonymous,10/2/2022 10:17:40 PM,"Pros: great picture decent HDR
Cons: I returned this monitor two times in the last 60 days due to the display failing to work in the return period. The monitor is great value but quality control is terrible and it will fail you. Get a monitor of a brand that will work instead of gigabyte constant failure
Overall Review: No fails too much RMA requires consumer pays shipping out $$$ for this monitor"
Anonymous,10/2/2022 8:20:12 AM,Overall Review: I had this monitor for about a month and it worked fine. After about a month it just started to either flicker or plain not work. It doesn't detect the HDMI. Waste of money
abdulrahman a.,10/1/2022 3:30:28 PM,"Pros: the price
Cons: poor quality 
the monitor very laggy when switch between mods
the HDR not stable !!
the monitor shake while i playing its not firm at all
sound speaker are so low and bad my laptop better than this monitor
Overall Review: i regret buying this and i think this is the last time i buy something from gigabyte"
Adam F.,9/20/2022 9:24:31 AM,"Pros: - It looks pretty good
- Resolution and refresh rate
- It has a fun clicky wheel thing to control settings
Cons: - 1 dead pixel a month in, with 3 other blemishes appearing to be pixels dying or following the first one. This supersedes any pros the monitor may have. Hopefully Gigabyte gets back quickly.
Overall Review: - Would not recommend."
Anonymous,8/1/2022 4:04:34 PM,"Overall Review: It's a great monitor, and the OSD Sidekick software is a lot easier to use compared to onboard controls. 

Unfortunately, like many others, mine was delivered with dead pixels. Of course it's covered by warranty, but it's frustrating spending money for a quality monitor just to be bogged down by a lacking quality control team. I still recommend it, just be sure to RMA until you receive what you paid for."
Anonymous,5/20/2022 11:25:51 AM,"Pros: Does what it says it does, to the extent I'd be able to tell. Used for programming and gaming.
Cons: I found the monitor had an annoying high pitch buzz while in standby mode that pulsed with the blinking standby light. Making it impossible to sleep nearby

I eventually 'fixed' it by MUTEing the audio in the monitor's built-in system settings (Just setting the speaker volume to 0 is not enough, must enable MUTE).
Overall Review: I don't see anyone else complain about the speaker buzz issue so maybe it's rare, or my house is about to burn down from bad electrical wiring. But just in case anyone runs into the issue (and doesn't need the built in speakers), that's the fix."
Anonymous,4/7/2022 7:58:12 AM,"Overall Review: I don't know with whom this issue lies, if it is Newegg or Gigabyte, but the quality control on these panels is abysmal. I have gone through 5, yes FIVE, of these monitors trying to get one that doesn't have a stuck/dead pixel ON ARRIVAL. I thought I hit the panel lottery with the latest one I have, but after 4 months there is a cluster of dead pixels in the lower left quadrant. Absolutely unacceptable for a monitor costing as much as it does. I have 4 other 144hz monitors from various other brands that I have owned for over 6 years with NO ISSUES EVER. This is unacceptable."
Anonymous,11/3/2021 11:12:50 AM,"Overall Review: Good IPS gaming monitor. It does what it says. 2k 144hz, 27"" diagonal. I tried it for a bit and decided 4k was better. Color gamut runs a little red, and black could be darker(although that could be said of all IPS). There's a noise in sleep mode; I hope this monitor isn't in your bedroom. Overall it's a great picture for gaming."
Henk,7/15/2021 9:55:00 AM,"Pros: - Text clarity a clear improvement over my old Acer 1080 (even though it is a gaming monitor)
- No dead pixels
- DP, HDMI, USB hub cables included
- Fast shipping
- Great price
Cons: Only minor. 
- It would be nice to have the power supply internal instead of yet another loose power brick.
- The settings button location should be on the bottom instead of behind the right side. If you put a second monitor to the right it blocks access to the settings button.
Overall Review: Great value and a great monitor for my (mostly) text use.
I also have a 27"" 4K monitor but found that on 4K the text is just too small to read. Lowering its resolution to 2560x1440 worked much better so I opted for a second 2560x1440 monitor. This is for me the perfect resolution/size ratio. 
The USB hub is nice too so the webcam which has a short cable can now just plug into the monitor."
Anonymous,6/27/2021 3:55:55 PM,"Pros: - the 1440p resolution and 27 inch for its price
- you can change the setting form you pc after connecting it via usb
- good response time
- the viewing angles are good 
-has good build quality
Cons: - if connected via DisplayPort every time the pc goes to sleep all your windows\apps and desktop icons moves to the main monitor , to fix this problem u have to use HDMI which remove the freesync feature and u have to tinker with the monitor settings to fix it + a firmware update is required . this gets old real quick .
- Low contrast ratio 
- HDR is a joke
Overall Review: overall its a good monitor for its price , I wont count on freesync with it because of the bad DisplayPort support 
if you want a good main monitor with freesync / G-sync I don't recommend this monitor tbh
I recommend it for people that will use it as secondary monitor"
Anonymous,5/22/2021 8:36:12 PM,"Pros: - Great colors.
- 144 hz
- Sturdy base.
- 1440p WQHD is the real deal.
- G-Sync compatible
Cons: - Light leaks. This a lottery, so, don't be surprised if it happens to you on arrival.
- Manual doesn't have a guide to navigating the settings properly, but, it can be done.
- A little bit of ghosting. But, if you're not a competitive player, it'll be fine. You won't notice.
Overall Review: I would recommend this one for single-player experiences, since colors are great, and the resolution when coming from 720p or 1080p is something else. It got some problems with dark representation, but that's something normal with LCD displays, but the light leaks are noticeable when playing movies with dark scenarios or loading screens in black (I would not recommend you a dark wallpaper though). 

In overall, is a good monitor for the price, not the best 1440p out there for sure, some things could have been done better. If you're coming for a lower resolution, want to enjoy single-player games as their max, and you're on a budget, this is your monitor."
Kyle B.,5/14/2021 7:16:33 AM,"Pros: 2k, HDR, Looks Great!
Cons: none so far
Overall Review: Going from 1080 to 1440 is more exciting than I expected and wouldn't go back after getting this monitor. The G27Q does it in style, with a great price. Its 100% buy."
Anonymous,5/12/2021 3:22:30 PM,"Pros: Looks phenomenal. With a little playing around, very easy to figure out the settings. Comes with all cords needed. Adds additional USB ports to use. Mine came with no dings or dead pixels and has held solid for a week now.
Cons: Cant think of any
Overall Review: Easy to recommend."
Anonymous,5/7/2021 7:59:18 AM,"Pros: It looks pretty good and pretty cheap
Cons: There is an issue with this monitor that I have read on several sites and can confirm that the issue is prevalent with mine. The monitor shuts off for 1 sec and comes back on after words. There is a clicking noise when it shuts off. I have seen from another posts that their monitor soon became dead afterwards. Mine has not reach that stage yet. Changing the display port cables did not fix the issue. Monitor is inconvenient so I use it as a secondary monitor.
Overall Review: I would not recommend based on the issue."
Anonymous,4/20/2021 9:45:14 AM,"Overall Review: Bought this off the rtings recommendation of this monitor as the best budget 144hz, 1440p, IPS monitor in the market, and I have to say, so far so good. Been using it for about a week now with absolutely no issue. Factory settings on the monitor weren't great, but a quick google search to find a set of optimal settings quickly solved that problem. 

Monitor was well-packaged, easy to put together, feels well built, and looks absolutely fantastic - no dead pixels or issues of any kind. As a note, the built-in speaker is absolutely awful, but if you're buying a monitor like this, I assume you're using a headset most of the time anyways.

Would definitely recommend this monitor for those looking for an excellent gaming monitor without totally breaking the bank."
Theresa F.,4/18/2021 10:06:50 AM,"Pros: Excellent video quality and resolution for a reasonable price. Note that I use this as a second monitor for my home office with limited use for gaming or similar, so I cannot comment on its capabilities for that use.
Cons: No issues so far.
Overall Review: I would recommend this monitor at least for a home office application. Nice size and crispness for clear text. I spend 12+ hours per day working on my computer, so this has been really nice to use."
Anonymous,4/7/2021 4:32:16 PM,"Pros: great price point for all the features

Anonymous,3/18/2021 6:41:54 AM,"Pros: - Great for coding and gaming.
- Not too bright, this is a personal Pro, since I struggle with eye strain being on computer 10h+ a day. Super bright displays kill my eyes
Cons: - I feel a small vibration in white areas, but when I focus I don't see anything, everything is sharp. Not sure if its my eyes not used to 1440p resolution, so I really will not consider this as an issue yet.
Overall Review: I do coding, gaming and sometimes I do watch short online videos etc. (not movies/series, I do have a TV for that). The display is really great, its sharp, I don't notice things professional reviewers mention like black uniformity, low contrast etc. Games are very sharp, no ghosting effects for me. Although I'm new to 1440p and 144hz displays (above 60hz), so for me this was a great purchase honestly."

eric b.,3/3/2021 8:19:50 AM,"Pros: good color, good response, son is happy.
Cons: had to apply a f/w upgrade to get it to offer 1440p/120hz to the xbox, via a PC, which had no problem negotiating 1440p/120hz from an amd rx5700. So once the f/w was upgraded, aok.
Overall Review: happy - good value.
cheaper than buying a 4k display"

Doug C.,9/10/2020 6:50:20 PM,"Pros: 1440 resolution is perfect for gaming and business use
144Hz refresh provides a solid picture, without any of the flicking problems with 60hz monitorins

Overall Review: Also first review for this monitor!"
Anonymous,9/6/2020 12:37:31 PM,"Pros: Great image
Cons: Control button
Overall Review: I really like this monitor, but I bought it knowing Gigabyte. Gigabyte has a pattern of releasing great hardware and then backing it up with absolutely awful software. A few years ago some of their software almost killed my Windforce 1080. As a side note, this monitor gets very hot so you probably shouldn’t touch the back during intense gameplay sessions.

This monitor meets expectations and exceeds in certain ways. Image is way better than expected. Refresh is fast and not a blurry mess. I have experienced some oddness with the control menu, sidekick and built-in, but that’s just the manufacturer. 

The control button is by far the most annoying part of the monitor. It doesn’t always work. The left click doesn’t seem to work at all. It’s not enough of a problem to make me swap the monitor out, but it’s just something you should be aware of. I had a far superior South Korean monitor with a very similar button and it worked flawlessly. I’m just annoyed that this one doesn’t.

As far as I can tell, “super resolution” is a gimmick. It just makes the monitor very, very grainy. Might be useful in some way but I’m still trying to figure out how.

With a fully-functional control button, this would be a 5 egg monitor. Better than I expected from Gigabyte, but not quite at the [unnamed competitors] level.

The most commonly accepted name for the directional control button is unacceptable? Get it together, Scrubegg."
Anonymous,9/6/2020 5:39:04 AM,"Pros: Great picture, great color, smooth experience. Was plug and play for me. 
Ragey review near the bottom is toxic and not indicative of this item at all. Please work on your emotional maturity. And learn to read; the g27qc is advertised as 165hz, not the g27q.
Cons: Will update if I find any but none so far.
Overall Review: Great item. Going to buy a second one soon."
Demitri,4/19/2021 12:39:03 PM,"Pros: All around a good screen no complaints about anything, Had a great time with it.
Cons: Backlight bleed with a brand new screen right on the top, Which sucks honestly...
Overall Review: I would of gave it 5 eggs right away if there wasn't that defect, Shame really."
Cory B.,5/27/2021 11:43:09 AM,"Pros: -2560 x 1440p
-IPS Panel/Great colors
-144Hz
-HDR
-Easy setup
-No backlight bleed (for me)
-Freesync works with my Nvidia card without flicker.
-Lots of extra features to configure on the monitor.
Cons: -Terrible built in speakers. Not knocking an egg off due to those. Its to be expected.

-Like others have mention. When the monitor goes into a ""sleep status"" my PC acts like a USB device was connected or disconnected and pulls the monitor out of the screensaver/sleep state. The monitor also keeps the backlight on when it does manage to go into the screensaver/sleep state. More of an annoyance than anything. I just turn the monitor off now when I'm done with my PC. This is the only issue I have with this monitor thus far.
Overall Review: Overall, I would recommend this monitor to those who want a 2k 144Hz IPS panel. I bought this monitor so I could have another 2k display. My other 2k monitor is a TN panel, but I wanted an IPS panel AND the difference in color is ridiculous to me. 

This monitor's blacks and color look amazing and not washed out vs a TN panel. Gaming looks great on this monitor and I'm happy overall with this purchase."
GIBRAN C.,12/9/2020 5:50:33 AM,"Pros: - Great IPS color 
- Price Value
- Cables Included (HDMI , Dport, SS)
- Freesync and Nvidia compatible
Cons: - QC , stopped work the the screen (black screen ) just after minutes of arrival when activated the HDR. the PC stills reconized the monitor but no image. very disapointing 
- Software OSD Obsolete (needs to improve).
Overall Review: It is a lottery, i recommended if you could return it incase anything goes wrong. In my case i brought with international delivery, i´m returning but i´d lost the expensive international shipping cost , i would prefer replace it with a new one or at least have the possibility that the guarantee can be applied here to repair. 

Its a great monitor with bad quality issues"
Hits,9/23/2020 8:34:45 AM,"Pros: It really looks great. Basically everything you paid for is what you will get. 144hx, 1ms, great color etc. Its all there and does it well. Settings joystick on back of monitor works great. Very easy to use.
Cons: -not thrilled with the bezel. i feel like what is shown in pictures and the dimensions is a little misleading. The bezel itself is slim (.25"") but when you turn the monitor on there is an additional black frame of another .25"". Actual bezel is about .5"" maybe a little less. minor gripe here but slightly annoying.

-The power cord has a brick and the cord leading down to power supply is not long enough. For me this means the brick is hanging by the power cord. Wouldnt hurt if the cord was 2' longer. Can we just get rid of power bricks once and for all?
Overall Review: Overall i would recommend this monitor based on the specs, however, i would also recommend you explore other monitors out there. This one won't do you wrong but if you are nitpicky you might want to pass."
Anonymous,11/23/2021 7:32:36 PM,"Pros: Looked great

I know its a small pixel but I spent my money on this and was expecting a good product with no issues, so now its complicated because I still have the box just I dont have the styrofoam it came in because like I said I expected a good product shame on me.

- Interface easy to use
- A wide variety of options to customize the monitor to your liking
Cons: - Button quality seems to be an issue in my case
Overall Review: Everything was working great on the first three days that i've had the monitor but recently the power/menu button on the bottom right corner keeps toggling as if i'm pressing it over and over again, I'm a little concerned because it seems to happen randomly. It doesn't seem possible that it would be damaged so soon consider the fact that i haven't moved it around at all since plugging it in and placing it on my desk. The menu interface appearing isn't too bothersome in the middle of games but the problem is sometimes it turns the monitor itself off and on repeatedly making it unusable for any purpose and i've had to wait around 20 minutes for it to stop happening once... I've had really bad luck with monitors over the past 2 years from a broken backlight out of the package to other major issues, and if i can help it i'd rather not have to get a replacement.."

- Can get very bright
- G-sync compatible
- Very nice UI
- Includes HDMI, DP, and USB-A to USB-B cable

- I heard there are a lot of quality control issue from gigabyte from forums.
- Gigabtye's only RMA if there is at least 3 bright dots or 5 dark dots.
- Higher input lag and ghosting at lower fps.
Overall Review: Coming from a 1080p 60 hz monitor, 1440p 144hz is quite the difference. Which was noticeable for me when playing Osu!.

Everything seems so much more clear. However, my monitor came with a few dead sub pixels ina middle of the screen.

I am running this monitor pretty will with an RTX 3060, however heat output was a big problem for my poor ventilated room with this monitor using 65W at max load along with my PC using about 220W during gaming.

I am not sure if the cause is the monitor, but I have the monitor connected via HDMI and when my PC put to sleep and turn back on again, all the programs on my 2nd monitor will go to the main monitor."
Anonymous,6/2/2021 4:59:43 PM,"Pros: great image quality if it works

Robert W.,3/30/2021 8:12:55 PM,"Pros: Hard to say, never worked more than an hour without a problem
Overall Review: It refuses to run at 144hz consistently. And in a two monitor setup at 144, it blanks both screen repeatedly. I got an RMA to have it repaired including a long explanation of the troubleshooting already done including swapping ports cables, etc. After a long three weeks it was returned today and amazingly NOT A THING HAS CHANGED!! So I'm stuck with a unusable monitor with the only option to buy another since I'm certain that they aren't going to replace it and I am not sending it back for another faux repair. It certainly won't ever be Gigabyte ever again....for anything. I'm only giving it one egg because I can't give it zero."

We'll today it just decided that it was no longer going to communicate with my computer. None of the ports work and I can't even pull up the monitor menu. And of course it is now passed the return date."
Anonymous,1/27/2021 9:56:12 AM,"Pros: It was cheap
Cons: It had terrible backlight bleed, made it annoying to look at anything slightly dark. Also had a small cluster of dead pixels near the middle of the screen.
Overall Review: I would not recommend nor buy this again, maybe it is a lottery, I returned it and bought something else. Return was hassle free during the holiday season, but took a while."
Jason G.,11/15/2020 8:36:11 AM,"Pros: This is my first IPS 1440p monitor. I have nothing to compare it to, except 2 other 1080p 144hz TN monitors. Side by side comparison, it’s on a whole different level. I played a 2k store demo on each monitor, and the level of clarity, detail, and color is vastly different.
Cons: I have no complaints so far.
Overall Review: I would recommend this monitor to anybody who is looking to get introduced into 1440p gaming."
DANIEL M.,10/12/2023 7:30:47 AM,"Pros: 1440P is a must for WZ.
Cons: The screen does not have an UP and Down to set at your eye level. I have to use a book. Go figure.
Overall Review: I like it, just has NO UP or Down feature to set at your eye level."
DK,6/29/2021 2:31:22 PM,"Pros: * Crisp and bright display.
* The dashboard app that you run on your desktop works well. It is a bit sluggish but I'm hoping that's because I connected to a USB 2.0 port. The APP gives complete control over the monitor settings. More useful than the actual controls on the monitor.
Cons: - The windows HDR setting that this monitor allows me to turn on for the first time is disappointing. But I've read that this is a general thought for other monitors as well. Maybe if I find a real HDR enabled game that I like, I'll update this comment.
Overall Review: I do recommend this as I haven't run into any serious negatives.

I DO recommend that IF you upgrade the firmware make certain you do the following:
1) After the firmware is updated and your monitor LED is doing a fast flashing... (making you think it is bricked!)
2) Wait at least 10 minutes!
3) Unplug the monitor for another 5 minutes.
4) Plug it back in. It should be fine. No more flashing light. You should have a green light.

I made the mistake of looking away when the firmware was updating and a few minutes later I looked back to see a black screen and my power led flashing. I thought ""Darn it! I have no idea if it is really done yet!"". So I waited a few minutes and finally decided I had to power it off and back on again. 
Nothing! Still fast flashing. :(

That sinking feeling that you bricked your brand new $300 monitor. Not fun! So I unplugged a few times - no joy.

I then disconnected everything and moved the monitor to the other side of the house and sulked for a while. A few minutes had gone by and I recalled from my electronics days that there is a possibility that the monitor still had juice from capacitors. My unplugging wasn't for long enough.

I held my breath and plugged the monitor in after it had been sitting for a few minutes.
Thank goodness it had a green light! 
Oh the joy AND it had updated the firmware. lol
Man that was scary."
Kimble S.,1/20/2026 11:05:12 AM,Overall Review: Highly Recommend for Engineering CAD or Gaming
Anonymous,1/10/2026 8:48:22 AM,"Pros: When it works, the resolution and performance is OK.
Cons: The single button system for controlling menu items, turning it on, turning it off, selecting inputs. That stinks. I hate it with every fiber of my being.

If it gets jiggled, it auto-selects some other input than what I was using. Considering how flaky the single-button has been for me, I'm not sure if this is a defect, or if it's how it was designed to work. If the desk it's on gets jiggled a bit, it goes into auto-detect.

When it goes into input auto-detect, IT IGNORES THE CONTROL BUTTON until it's done doing it's thrashing about - for about 20 seconds. Only after 20 seconds does the idiot thing stop thrashing, and allow me to use the button to force the blasted thing back to using the input that I had it set to.

This may be defective behavior, as it only started doing it after a year or so.

NEVER, EVER, buying another Gigabyte product.
Overall Review: I would only recommend this display to ... my worst enemy."
Anonymous,12/15/2025 10:16:23 AM,"Pros: This 180 hz monitor has beautiful picture/color and is silky smooth for gaming.
Cons: One bad pixel that goes cyan when it should be black.
Overall Review: Unclear if I could have this fixed with a truly cost-free RMA."
Anonymous,12/10/2025 6:08:54 PM,Overall Review: The display is really clear and at a good size with 27 inches. 180 Hz is also great as well for the price point.
Jose G.,12/8/2025 6:22:03 PM,"Pros: Cant complain.
Cons: Monitor Stand have limited adjustment.
Overall Review: Amazing IPS monitor for the price."
Angelo C.,12/5/2025 11:06:57 AM,"Cons: Missing HDMI cables . Now I have to spend more money to buy some. Frustrating and Inconvenient.
Will find out if the monitor even works after buying the cables.
Overall Review: Dont recommend this product to others.
This is already the second time they mess this order. Already been delayed. I want to return it but at this point im just tired and defeated."
Anonymous,12/2/2025 1:59:12 AM,"Pros: the monitor itself looks great and feels great at 2560x1440 180Hz
Cons: The stand that comes with the monitor is very cheap and wobbles very easy at the slightest of movements at your desk even just moving your mouse. I now have to get a new monitor stand it's so bad.
Overall Review: I would recommend this monitor if you either mind having a wobbly monitor or are willing to shell out more money for a real monitor stand. But if you are not inclined to have that experience then I would not recommend this monitor."

Anonymous,7/17/2025 8:11:23 PM,"Pros: Decent quality. Good RMA.
Cons: Break within one year I've had many problems with it. Self triggering buttons and flickering screen. ON BOTH MONITORS BTW! I bought two sadly.
Overall Review: If ur fine with something that doesnt last long buy it its a good monitor anyway."
Michael4Times,2/12/2025 3:26:03 PM,"Pros: Picture in Picture Mode
Cons: Stand is awful
Overall Review: This monitor is good. 1440p at 240hz with a good IPS panel is relatively rare at this price. After buying my last monitor, I've been extremely wary about ghosting, but this monitor's is very minimal. Personally, I don't see a huge difference in 240hz and 144hz when I'm playing games on controller, but when I play competitive mouse and keyboard games, I really feel it. It doesn't make me some sort of aimbot or anything, just feels nicer. As the cons show, the stand is absolutely terrible. Pretty much just the bare minimum with slight vertical rotation, no horizontal rotation, no height adjustment, and a fairly large 6.5 x 6.5 in square footprint. I would really recommend using some sort of 3rd party stand or arm. A good plus that I only noticed after the monitor came in is that it has Picture in Picture mode. Important note about the Picture in Picture mode, it caps your refresh rate to a max of 75. There are 3 size options and you can choose for the picture to be in any of the 4 corners of the screen. Pretty awesome feature but I do wish it still allowed the use of 240 hertz, or at least 144."
Anonymous,12/6/2024 8:00:19 AM,"Pros: Good picture
Cons: Setup? Input recognition?
Overall Review: Once I got them working, they're great. I have never had any issue swapping monitors. I built a new comp recently, did setup on wife's work monitors (3x over usbc dock), and spent a minute playing on tv hdmi while I decided on overall setup. Everything worked fine. Swapped over to 2 of these, no signal. Swapped cables. Swapped dp to hdmi. Swapped gpu ports and mobo video. Swapped surge prot. Changed and mixed outlets. They were getting power but we do what we do. Manually changed inputs. Nothing. I then mirrored from my laptop, perfect. Plugged back into new pc, and everything was like a prom date. I'm leaning toward a display issue with the new pc, but I can't think what it could have been. Again though, great monitors for the black friday price. For the $199 currently, I'd go for something with height adj and speakers. I'm very tall and sometimes I don't want things on my head."
J W.,10/3/2024 2:47:49 PM,Overall Review: Good monitor for a good price!
Dylan B.,9/7/2024 8:55:44 AM,"Pros: Steady base
Great quality
Easy to set up
Came with all the cords
Overall Review: I will purchase this product again"
Anonymous,8/26/2024 7:53:13 PM,"Pros: The working monitor has a nice sharp picture, set up was easy, and it came with an assortment of international power cables, which was a nice touch.
Cons: Unfortunately, the other monitor, as can be seen in the photos, has a persistent display issue. I have tried different cables, different ports, different PCs - no luck. I was still in the process of building the PC this was intended for when it arrived and sadly the return period has passed or I would be sending it back in a heartbeat.
Overall Review: I recommend if you feel like gambling...."
Anonymous,8/24/2024 1:18:01 PM,"Pros: Great picture quality, HDR, and brightness, OSD software is great. Stand is really sturdy and build quality is nice. The height adjustable stand is very easy to use and sturdy.
Cons: Speakers are meh/average, though I don't think anyone buys a monitor intending to rely on the speakers, but if you need them they are usable. I had to return the first monitor I bought because it had stuck pixels. The second monitor that came in was perfect with no dead pixels or stuck pixels.
Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this monitor, I think for the price it is an amazing 2K resolution monitor with a good refresh rate and response time. This is the 2nd monitor I have bought in the Gigabyte line and I think I will continue to buy them considering the price and what you get for it."
Anonymous,8/20/2024 8:43:02 AM,"Overall Review: My first QHD monitor, looks great! The menu is a little hard to navigate with the joystick, but thats the only complaint I have."
Jose D.,8/2/2024 8:47:28 AM,"Pros: - Very well packed
- Good monitor for the price
Cons: It came with the cover lifted in several places, at the top left and at the bottom in the center, I was able to place the top one by applying pressure, but it was impossible for me to place the bottom one properly. I don't know if I should try to take the monitor apart and try to place it properly or leave it like that, but I find it regrettable that a new product for this price comes with these defects.

Michael S.,5/9/2024 8:30:14 AM,"Pros: Like the monitor but something is off with the refresh rate.
Cons: Plugged into display cable to system which has a GTX 3060TI card. When we go into set the refresh rate it only lets us max out at 144hz. This items shows 165hz. I also looked on the Gigabyte website and it also shows 144hz Refresh. I am waiting on a response back from Gigabyte to confirm what im seeing to make sure what you all are advertising is correct.
Overall Review: we will see once i here back from Gigabyte and what your response it."
Pecks,4/21/2024 5:03:13 AM,"Pros: Cleaner, crisper, bigger, but it's not the resolution that shines, it's the size. I didn't think going from 24"" to 27"" would be much difference, but I felt a change in immersion. Sadly, that immersion becomes the new norm. 

Is it worth $50 more than you would have paid for 1080p? Yes, but not $100 more as some prices go. This was $70 extra compared to 1080 prices. Do I recommend it? No, but it's still nice. 

Going from 720p to 1440p is a worthy jump and I believe going from 1080p to 4k is a worthy jump. But my jump was miniscule and I really only paid to have a resolution that best suits the screen size. 

I both regret my purchase and don't. Had I known my experiences ahead of time, I wouldn't have made the purchase, but I'm exposed to 27 inches now and can't go back.
Cons: Not a big deal
Overall Review: Satisfied and regretdul"
Bryan L.,4/17/2024 9:07:32 AM,"Pros: This monitor is the bomb. Going to this from a 27"" is life changing.
Got this on sale and it is an absolute steal bang for your buck deal, Highly recommend if you are upgrading to QHD 2k.
No issues with dead pixels, i never understood why people complain about doas etc just return it and get a new one my guy.
Cons: The power cord to power the monitor is very short but with a power surge or extension, no problem.
Other than that, not much!
Overall Review: Highly recommend and yes i would def buy again."
Anonymous,3/19/2024 10:37:21 PM,"Overall Review: This is my first 1440p monitor (coming from an ancient 1080p Acer monitor that needed no fancy stuff) so took a bit of tinkering settings and just generally getting used to stuff being bigger or upscaled. 

Overall it was easy to put together and well packaged. Has a lot of settings to change to your liking.

Only thing I kind of dislike is the joystick for the monitor settings is also the on/off switch. While I like the joystick better for driving through the monitor settings. Its very fiddly and annoying when just wanting to turn the monitor off."
Zach A.,3/12/2024 8:25:40 AM,"Pros: - Great picture

LM,3/10/2024 5:42:50 PM,"Pros: The 4-way directional button to navigate menus is nice, particularly in the dark.
Cons: The mount points are recessed, and in such a way that there is very little room for a typical mount plate to fit into that recess. I had to buy spacers and longer screws to make it work.

What dropped this to 3 eggs for me is that the power cord has a transformer in the middle, making it real annoying because the transformer is heavy and pulls on the cord if I let it hang, but takes up space on or under my desk if I don't want it to hang. It really limits the ability my monitor arm's range of motion without yanking on cords.
Overall Review: The monitor itself is good. I will not buy another because of the power cord and mount points being recessed."

My only complaint is where the power button is placed on the back. It makes it kind of difficult to find and turn off because of where it is. Also its a weird type of button that has to be held for a couple seconds. Other than that, I love these monitors and would recommend."
Glen F.,2/14/2024 12:18:25 PM,"Pros: Vibrant but not accurate colors
Good for gaming type things only
Cons: Their software is bad (horrible), I have not been able to use either at all. Support is this, one support refers you to another, where there is no response, a dead end. 
 Cables are not as advertised. I received none of the 2 USB nor the 2 HDMI cable. Instead getting non USA cables.

The joystick control on the back of monitor works BUT your settings will not survive a restart or shutdown/restart. Poof just gone. Enjoy resetting your preferences for EVER!
Overall Review: Very unhappy with the support and the software. Colors for gaming only are the only benefits of this monitor.

I'll not purchase Anything from GIGABYTE again."

One thing to be careful of: the on/off switch and controls for contrast, etc. is a little nubbin on the back of the screen that could easily get snagged by a stray cord. I'm afraid it's going to break and render the monitor useless."
